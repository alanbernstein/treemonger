* treemonger

inspired by http://edgerunner.com/spacemonger, since every other visual space mapping program uses a bad subdivision algorithm, but spacemonger is windows only.

there are some outstanding user interface features, and the rendering/clipping needs some work. otherwise, this is currently highly usable.

example:

* UI

- mouse1 (left click) to print file info to terminal
- mouse2 (middle click in ubuntu) to copy path to clipboard
- mouse3 (right click in ubuntu) to open file
- 'q' to quit
